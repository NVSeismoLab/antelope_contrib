.SH DESCRIPTION
This little helper parses the EMSC webpage continuously for new events and saves them in a \fIdatabase\fP.
It uses the event IDs assignerd by EMSC. This allow to only have the preferred events in the \fIdatabase\fP which
can be very convenient in conjunction with dbloc2.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-v"
verbose flag
.IP "-n pages"
go back \fIn\fP on the webpage. This allows to retrieve older information.
.IP "-s seconds"
pause this many \fIseconds\fP between each iteration. Defaults to 900 \fIseconds\fP or 15 minutes.
.IP "-p proxy-url"
use proxy, e.g. machine:port. If this is not specified, the environment variable \fBhttp_proxy\fP is used.
.IP "-u url"
Url of EMSC webpage. Defaults to \fBhttp://www.emsc-csem.org/Earthquake/?view=\fP.
.IP "database"

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
It appears the perl interpreter has tiny memory leaks. It might be a good idea to restart the program every other month.
The script depends on the structure of the webpage of the EMSC and may easily break if they change the format. Contact the author for a recent version...
