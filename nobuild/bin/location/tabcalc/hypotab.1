.SH NAME
hypotab - companion program to tabcalc travel time calculator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
hypotab
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This is an ancient, FORTRAN code that is a companion to 
tabcalc(1).  All it does is read the complete set of curves
that include reversed branches and shadow zones, and sorts
out the first arrival at each distance.  The output is 
a uniform grid grid travel time table compatible with
genloc.
.LP
The program asks for one input parameter interactively with
a free field read.  This parameter is the number of distance
points desired for the output table.  There is a maximum
that is currently 1000 points. 
.SH FILES
.IP (1)
This program looks for a fixed named file called "vmodel".
It's structure is described in tabcalc(1).  
.IP (2)
The main input to this program is a fixed named file
called "txpxall" that is a binary output file of tabcalc(1).
.IP (3)
The output has the fixed name of "txpxone".  Simply change
this to something like P_anza.pf.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
Base code has been pretty thoroughly exercised.  Some recent
changes to expand an older barrier on the table size have
not been thoroughly tested as of June 1998l
