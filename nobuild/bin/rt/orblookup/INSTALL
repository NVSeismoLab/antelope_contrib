1) Run 'config' to generate a pf file for orblookup.
2) Run 'make'.
3) If all went well, run 'make install'.
4) Copy 'orblookup' to its final destination in your web tree.  For simplicity,
    this can be your executable directory, e.g. /cgi-bin.
5) Make sure this file is executable by the web server and is recognized as
    a cgi script.  This may require changing its extension.
6) Start orblook for whatever orbs you've configured it to use.
