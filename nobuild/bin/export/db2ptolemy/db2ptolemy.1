.SH NAME
db2ptolemy \- pretty-print a database view as a Ptolemy II expression
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBdb2ptolemy \fP[-v] [-p] 
                \fIdbname.table\fP [\fIname\fP \fIexpr\fP [\fIname\fP \fIexpr\fP
                ...]]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBdb2ptolemy\fP prints a database table or view as a Ptolemy II expression that
will evaluate to an array of records in Ptolemy II.

With no command-line arguments other than the table pathname, all
table fields are printed, each as its own element. the -p option
limits the fields shown to the primary keys. The output 
is sent to standard-out.

Optionally, all of the fields in each row may be individually
specified on the command line. Each field is defined by a
pair of command line arguments, first a (Ptolemy) field \fIname\fP and then
an expression to be evaluated by the Antelope expression calculator
(see the man page for dbexpressions(5)). Care should be taken
to use quotes where necessary to protect expressions from the
shell.

.SH OPTIONS

-v Verbose

-p Only print out the primary keys as elements

.SH RETURN VALUES
\fBdb2ptolemy\fP exits with 0 upon success, nonzero upon error.
